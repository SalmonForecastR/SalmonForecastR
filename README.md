Welcome to the **SalmonForecastR**!

This is the new home for the growing *SalmonForecastR* community, with all the components in one place:

* *[Releases Repo](https://github.com/SalmonForecastR/ForecastR-Releases)*: links to online versions of the shiny app (alternative mirror sites), announcements of major releases, feedback and bug reports in the issue threads, links to available reports, wiki pages summarizing the tools and statistical methods.
* *[Package Repo](https://github.com/SalmonForecastR/ForecastR-Package)*: R package source for install, if you want to use the *SalmonForecastR* on the command line (e.g. create custom analysis scripts inside RStudio to process a batch of stocks)
* *[App Repo](https://github.com/SalmonForecastR/ForecastR-App)*: Shiny app source code if you want to run the app locally (e.g. to improve speed, to have access while in the field).


Enjoy,

[Antonio](https://github.com/avelez-espino), [Gottfried](https://github.com/SOLV-Code), [Michael](https://github.com/MichaelFolkes), and the rest of the team.
